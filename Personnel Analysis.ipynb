      "All qualification and time-in-grade (if applicable) requirements must be met within 30 days of the closing date of this announcement. You must meet the minimum qualification requirements as stated in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Operating Manual, Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/Standards/group-stds/gs-prof.asp. Basic Requirements:\n",
      "Degree: accounting or a related field (such as business administration, finance, or public administration) that included or was supplemented by 24 semester hours (or 36 quarter hours) in accounting (may include up to 6 hours of business law).\n",
      "OR\n",
      "Combination of education and experience: 4 years of accounting experience or a combination of accounting experience, college-level education, and training that provided professional accounting knowledge AND 24 semester hours (or 36 quarter hours) in accounting/auditing courses or a certificate as Certified Public Accountant or a Certified Internal Auditor. Specialized Experience: In addition to meeting the basic requirements, you must have one year of specialized experience at the GS-13 or equivalent level. Specialized experience must be documented in your resume. Specialized experience includes serving as a supervisory auditor responsible for planning, organizing and directing audit team work; conducting quality assurance review of auditor work papers and reports, and presenting review results to upper management; providing technical staff assistance and guidance to field audit offices in a variety of complex and highly technical audit program areas; planning and conducting technical, complex and comprehensive audits demonstrating an expert knowledge of audit standards. Volunteer Experience: Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional, philanthropic, religious, spiritual, community, student, social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills, and can provide valuable training and experience that translates to paid employment. You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. PAY: Locality Pay does not apply to the European Branch Office (EBO). U. S. locality pay will be discontinued upon assignment. Currently, employees assigned to the EBO in Wiesbaden receive Post (Cost of Living Allowance) and Living Quarters Allowance (LQA), both are nontaxable. These allowances are computed on Department of State guidelines and are subject to change. Current Cost of Living Allowance is at a 10% index which is applied to the expendable income determined based on gross base salary. Example of Salary Per Pay Period for hypothetical selection of current GS-14 step 5, base salary of $102,705. Base Pay - 80 hours $3,936.80\n",
      "Living Quarters Allowance $1,807.00* Post Allowance ** $156.00* $5,899.80 *For a family of two (including the employee). Employees may receive increments for additional family members.\n",
      "**Post Allowance amount is determined based on annual salary and family size.Note: Stateside locality pay will be discontinued upon reassignment overseas. LQA and Post Allowances are non-taxable. Rate varies by actual cost and the value of the EURO. Rate for LQA shown in example is the maximum amount for the sample base salary; the employee receives either the maximum rate or the amount of allowable expenses, whichever is lower. Both LQA and Post Allowance are nontaxable. TOUR OF DUTY: The initial tour of duty is 36 months in length, with a possible extension of up to an additional 24 months, subject to mission needs, employee performance and management approval. Extensions are not guaranteed. Selected candidates(s) must agree to complete their full 36 month tour. Employees will be required to sign a transportation agreement and minimum service agreement prior to their assignment overseas. GENERAL INFORMATION: The European Branch Office is located in Wiesbaden, Germany which is approximately 20 miles from Frankfurt. The climate is noted for mildness, however, there is considerable rainfall in the spring and winter months. Knowledge of the German language is not essential, as English is a second language for many Germans. A non-taxable housing allowance is paid to compensate for housing rental costs, electricity and heating of the house. Food, clothing, and automobile services may be more expensive on the economy, but are available at reasonable prices at facilities provided by the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES). These services are offered to military ID holders which include DCAA employees and their dependents under 21 years of age unless that dependent is working here for the military and therefore entitled to their own ID card. Applicants should be aware that jobs for dependents, especially professional positions, can be difficult but not necessarily impossible to obtain. The definition of \"Dependent/Immediate Family\" for civilian employees can be found in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Volume 2 (Appendix A, Part I). For a selectee to bring a Non- Dependent to Germany, the Non-Dependent will need to either be granted a Permanent Resident Visa thru the German Consulate or be given Member of Household status through the Garrison in Wiesbaden. These processes must be approved before relocating to Germany as they are both difficult to obtain. Applicants are responsible for obtaining relevant information regarding the qualification and application process for Resident Visa and Member of Household. Non- dependent members of the family do not have the same privileges as dependents on employee's PCS order. Public transportation in Europe and particularly in Germany is abundant, timely, and comfortable. Wiesbaden is centrally located and offers vacation travel opportunities for auditors and their dependents assigned to the FAO. In addition, there are a few U.S. Government owned hotels available in Europe through the Armed Forces Recreation Centers. Government hotels offer reasonable priced rates to DOD travelers. Restaurants and other eating-laces are abundant in Europe. Shipment of ONE privately owned vehicle at Government expense is authorized, subject to prior approval. EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS: Travel by commercial aircraft is a condition of employment. The Government will not pay air fare for the relocation move to Germany for dependent children who are 21 years of age or older. See additional comments in the housing paragraph below. The tour of duty is three years and employees must complete transportation and minimum service agreements prior to assignment overseas and returning to the CONUS position. Reemployment rights are granted for return to CONUS position in accordance with DCAA INSTRUCTION NO. 1400.19 dated June 28, 2016.\n",
